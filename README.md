# NestJS Backend Development Template

This repository provides a template for developing a backend with NestJS, equipped with modern tools and practices to streamline development and ensure scalability.

## Key Features

1. **Prisma ORM**  
   - Prisma is used for efficient and type-safe database interaction. It simplifies working with databases, allowing you to write clean and maintainable database queries.

2. **JWT Authentication**  
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to secure the application and manage authentication. This ensures safe and easy access to protected endpoints and data retrieval.

3. **EFK Stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana)**  
   - The EFK stack is integrated to monitor system performance and activity. Elasticsearch provides full-text search capabilities, Fluentd is used for logging, and Kibana enables visualizing logs and system metrics.

4. **Swagger API Documentation**  
   - Swagger is used to auto-generate interactive API documentation, enabling developers to explore and test endpoints directly in the browser. This simplifies development and testing.
